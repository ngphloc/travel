Finding yourself daydreaming about Kellogg's Frosties, Pringle's potato chips, Twining's tea or Campbell's soup? A good place to satisfy these urges is Minimart on the 2nd floor of the Saigon Intershop (just off of Le Loi Boulevard). Prices here are as cheap as the street markets. It's open 9 am to 6pm daily.
