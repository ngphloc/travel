Buses depart from central Saigon at Me Linh Square (by the Saigon River) and continue along Tran Hung Dao Boulevard to Binh Tay Market in Cholon, thenreturn the same route. The bus company running this route is an Australian joint venture - buses have air-con and video movies and driver is well dressed! All this for US$0.25. Buy your ticket on board from the female attendant.
