A stone's throw from the Rex Hotel, Rex Garden Restaurant is in an attractive setting and serves good Vietnamese and French dishes. You can dine in air-con comfort, or outside surrounded by views of past and present - on one side an army tank and on the other a row of tennis courts where Saigon's nouveaux-riches swat at little yetlow balls in the heat.
