It is a indoor-outdoor eatery in the city centre, popular with locals, which serves amazingly cheap and tasty Vietnamese BBQ. The house specility is tender marinated beef (about US$2 a portion, including a salad) which you grill over charcoal right at your table. There are also good seafood dishes on the menu, and the cheerful staff speak English.
