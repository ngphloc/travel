The enormous New World Hotel is a slick luxury tower and one of the most upmarket hotels in Saigon. The clientele tends to be mainly Chinese-speaking tour groups from Hong Kong and Taiwan, but anyone with hard currency s welcome. Rates start at US$65 and creep right up to the pressidential suite, which goes for a cool US$850.
