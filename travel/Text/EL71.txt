Perhaps the best rub-down in town is at the Vietnamese Traditional Medicine Institute, very close to the Pham Ngu Lao area. Here you can enjoy a no-nonsense massage performed by well-trained blind masseuses. The cost is just US$2 per hour (air-con comfort will set you back an extra dollar). There is also a sauna room available for US$1.50 per hour. Walk-in service is from 9 am to 8 pm daily.
