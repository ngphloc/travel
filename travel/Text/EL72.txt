The Ho Chi Minh Military Museum is just across Nguyen Binh Khiem Street (on the corner of Le Duan Boulevard) from the main gate of the zoo. US, Chinese and Soviet war material is on display outdoors, including a Cessna A-37 of the South Vietnamese air force and a US-built F-SE Tiger with the 20mm nose gun still loaded. The tank on display is one of the tanks which broke into the grounds of Reunification Palace on 30 April 1975
