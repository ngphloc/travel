The Saigon Water Park is a giant oasis in the suburbs of Saigon. This refreshing complex on the banks of the Saigon river is a chock-full of pools and water rides: loop-the-loop slides, a children's wading pool and even a 'wave pool'.
This Australian-built leasuire land is the perfect antidote for anyone who needs to cool down from an overdose of pagode and museum. Except for the weekend crowds, there is absolutely nothing traditionally Vietnamese about the place, right down to the real live lifegruads whistling out their Baywatch fantasies. Anyone with kids and a half-day to spare will quickly come to appreciate this wet and wonderful playground on a sweltering Saigonday. Bring a water-proof camera. There is alse a restaurant here with fine views over the river.
The park is open 9 am to 5 pm Monday to Friday, 9 am to 8 pm Saturday and 8 am to 8 pm on Sunday and public holidays. The best time to avoid the crowds is between 11 am and 2 pm on wekkdays (most Vietnamese stay out of the midday sun) - but this is also the best time of day to get sunburnt.
The all-you-can-splash and slide entry fee is 60,000d (USD$4.30). Children (define as people under 1.1m in height) pay 35,000d (US$2.50).
Saigon Water Park is on Kha Van Can Street in the Thu Duc District (near Go Dua Bridge). It's too far cyclos, but you can take a meter taxi for about US$4, or catch a shuttle bus (once every half-hour) from Ben Thanh Market for US$0.40.
The first international standard Water Park in Vietnam, has been recognized and accepted as the most exciting and entertaining outdoor water-based facility in HCMC.
