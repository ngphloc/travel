This place is fascinating not only by its size and modern architectural style, but also by its history. In 1868 was built at this site the Norodom Palace. Then the new mansion named Independence alace was constructed in 1962 and renamed the Reunification Palace since 1975. Perhaps most interesting of all is the basement with its network of tunnels, telecommunications centre and war room. The palace is open from 7.30 to 11.30 am and 1 to 5 pm daily except for official receptions or meetings.
