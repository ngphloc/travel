This restaurant, right in the city centre, may be the only restaurant in Vietnam specialising in Cambodian-inspired Khmer cuisine. This stylish little bistro is run by Daniel Hung, a French photographer born to Khmer/Vietnamese parents, who serves beautiful presented traditional Khmer dishes ata very reasonable prices.
