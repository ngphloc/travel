The long-standing Grival Restaurant, across the street from the Continental Hotel, has excellent selections of cakes, home-made ice cream and yoghurt. This Japanese joint venture also does kotobuk-style pastries. Aside from the junk food, there's French, Chinese, Vietnamese and Russian cuisine on the menu.
