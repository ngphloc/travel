It is perhaps the best Vietnamese restaurant in the city centre. The selection of fine, traditional dishes drawing from southern, central and northern Vietnamese cokking styles is superb, and the pleasant decor and live traditional music performances make it an all-round good bet. A house speciality worth trying is the Hanoi-style cha ca.
