Out near the airport is the No 7 Army Museum. Despite the fancy exterior , it's an unimpressive display. The main feature is yet an other statue of Ho Chi Minh, through there is a small collection of tanks behind the main building. There are a few photos from the French-ear Viet Minh battles. Visitors are few, and it is often closed during opening hour (7.30 to 11 am and 1.30 to 5 pm Monday to Saturday). Admission is free.
