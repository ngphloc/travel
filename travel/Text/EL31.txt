Constructed by the French from 1877 to 1883, the Notre Dame Cathedral is set in the heart of Saigon's gorvement quarter. The cathedral is on Han Thuyen street, facing Dong Khoi street. It is a fine landmark with its neo-Romanesque, red brick facade, two 40-metre-high square towers, tipped with iron spires, that dominate the city's skyline. In frontf of the cathedral (int the centre of the square bounded by the main post office) is a statue os the Virgin Mary. If the front gates are locked try the door on the side of building that faces Reunification Palace.
Unusually, this cathedral has no stained-glass windows. The glass was a casualty of fighting during WWII. A number of foreign travellers worship here and the priests are allowed to add a short sermon in French or English to their longer presentation in Vietnamese. 
There are many masses daily and the 9.30 am Sunday mass might be the best one for foreigners or tourists to attend.
