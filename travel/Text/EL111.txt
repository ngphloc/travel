One of the better deals in the city centre is Dien Luc Hotel. It has the sterility and look of new hospital, but belongs to the Ministry of Energy (the agency responsible for the frequent power blackouts that grip Vietnam). Rooms cost US$15 to US$25 (they get cheaper as you go upstairs and feature IDD phone and satellite TV).
